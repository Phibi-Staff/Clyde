Clyde is Back! You can invite it to your server.

Hi everyone ,

           We want to tell you something about the greatest launch of Clyde made by Graggle and Phibi . 
Clyde as you know is an integrating Discord bot, officially made by the Discord.Inc. At first, it was an application, which appeared as a webhook-type-profile and used to change 
the nicknames, tell users about the errors in their messages. But, after a longtime, I, Phibi, requested other officers and created the bot in Discord Developers Application. 
It has a lot of features including moderation features,games, discord notifications etc.

Clyde has been accepted in the Discord Bot List:
